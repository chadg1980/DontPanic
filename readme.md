DontPanic

Don't Panic is a wikipedia viewer that I modeled after the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy which is a book within the book, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Which has all of the knowledge of the universe inside. I thought wikipedia has all the knowledge of earth, so I melded the two together.
